    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        There are five extra actions available after the fringe-fitting process, independent of te Dynob's performance monitoring and feedback system. This function allows the creating of level1 vgosDB semi-automatically by runnig executing five URIs separately. Oaf and ops7 are the default for preparing the analysis and creating the vgosDB. Please change the <i>common/global.php</i>settings if using other machines. <span style="color:red">IMPORTANT: this script will only work if the entire session was processed by Dynob from correlation to fringe-fitting, except for action 1.</span> 
    </p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    All automation for this part is handled by the <i>dynob.tasphys.ga/createdb/lv1db.php?exper=sessionname&do=action</i>. Replace the <i>sessionname</i> with the session to process, and the <i>action</i> with the following. Please run the steps in correct order unless some of the steps have been done manually.
